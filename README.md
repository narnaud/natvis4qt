## Integration

### Visual Studio

Normally you don't have to do anything, the natvis files are copied in a central place that is used by Visual Studio.

See documentation here: [Natvis file locations](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/create-custom-views-of-native-objects?view=vs-2022#BKMK_natvis_location)

### Visual Studio Code

In order to use this natvis file in VS Code, you need to add a `visualizerFile` to your launch configuration. Edit your `launch.json` file (or the `launch` section of your `*.code-workspace` file) and add something like that:

```
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Current Target (VS)",
            "type": "cppvsdbg",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "${command:cmake.launchTargetPath}",
            "visualizerFile": "${QTDIR}/natvis/qt6.natvis",
            "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
            "sourceFileMap": {
                "C:/work/build/qt5_workdir/w/s": "${QTDIR}/../Src",
                "Q:/qt5_workdir/w/s": "${QTDIR}/../Src",
                "C:/Users/qt/work/install": "${QTDIR}/../Src",
                "C:/Users/qt/work/qt": "${QTDIR}/../Src"
            }
        }
    ]
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `QTDIR` environment variable must be set up before launching VS Code
